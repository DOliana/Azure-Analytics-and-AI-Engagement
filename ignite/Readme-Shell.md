## Overview

![Showcase Image](media/architectureDiagramFabric.png)

This lab showcases Modern Analytics with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks, featuring a cost-effective, performance-optimized, and cloud-native Analytics solution pattern. This architecture unifies our customers' data estate to accelerate data value creation. The visual illustrates the real-world example for Contoso, a fictitious company. Contoso is a retailer with thousands of brick-and-mortar stores across the world. They also have an online store. Contoso is acquiring Litware Inc. Litware Inc. has curated marketing data and sales data processed by Azure Databricks and stored in the gold layer in ADLS Gen 2. During our exercises, we will see how they leveraged the power of Microsoft Fabric to ingest data from disparate sources, combine data with their existing data from ADLS Gen2, and derive meaningful insights. You will witness how the team used a shortcut to reference the existing Litware Inc data from ADLS Gen2. You will also see how they mounted the OneLake endpoint in Azure Databricks to derive meaningful insights using the compute in Azure Databricks.

The lab scenario starts on January 30th. The company's new CEO, April, recently noticed negative trends in their KPIs, including:

* High customer churn
* Declining sales revenue
* High bounce rate on their website
* High operating expense
* Poor customer experience

April asks Rupesh, the Chief Data Officer how they could create a data driven organization and reverse these adverse KPI trends. Rupesh talks to his technical team, including Eva, the data engineer, Miguel, the data scientist and Wendy, the business analyst to design and implement a solution pattern to realize this dream of a data driven organization. Our story is centered around Rupesh and his team. They recognize that the existence of data silos within Contoso's various departments presents a significant integration challenge.

During this lab you will execute some of these steps as a part of this team to reverse these adverse KPI trends.

Here are the Microsoft Fabric workloads showcased in this solution along with Azure Databricks.

**1. Synapse Data Engineering**

Combines the best of the data lake and warehouse, removing the friction of ingesting, transforming, and sharing organizational data, all in an open format. Users can choose from various ways of bringing data into the Lakehouse including dataflow & pipelines, and they can even use shortcuts to create virtual folders and tables without any data movement between the storage accounts. The goal is to simplify the process of working with organizational data. Rather than spending time on integrating various products, managing infrastructure, and stitching together a spectrum of data sources, Microsoft aims to empower data engineers to focus on their core responsibilities and tasks.


**2. Data Factory**

Data Factory empowers users with a modern data integration experience to ingest, prepare and transform data with intelligent transformations, and leverage a rich set of activities. Data Factory primarily implements dataflows and pipelines.	Dataflows provide a low-code interface for ingesting data from hundreds of data sources, with 300+ data transformations. Data pipelines enable powerful workflow capabilities to build complex ETL and data factory workflows that can perform many different tasks at scale, refresh dataflow, move PB-size data, and define sophisticated control flow pipelines.	With its fast copy (data movement) capabilities in both dataflows and data pipelines, it enables users to move data between stores blazing fast.


**3. Synapse Data Science**

Microsoft Fabric offers Data Science experiences, empowering users to complete a wide range of activities across the entire data science process. All the way from data exploration, preparation and cleansing to experimentation, modeling, model scoring and serving of predictive insights to BI reports. Synapse Data Science in Microsoft Fabric allows data science practitioners to work seamlessly on top of the same secured and governed data that has been prepared by data engineering teams. This eliminates the need to copy data. The open Delta Lake support allows data science users to version datasets to create reproducible machine learning code.


**4. Synapse Data Warehouse**

Microsoft Fabric introduces a lake centric data warehouse built on an enterprise grade distributed processing engine that enables industry leading performance at scale while eliminating the need for configuration and management. The Warehouse is built for any skill level - from the citizen developer through to the professional developer, DBA or data engineer. The rich set of experiences built into Microsoft Fabric workspace enables customers to reduce their time to insights by having an easily consumable, always connected dataset that is integrated with Power BI in Direct Lake mode.


**5. Power BI**

Power BI is standardizing open data formats by adopting Delta Lake and Parquet as its native storage format to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce data duplication and management. Direct Lake mode unlocks incredible performance directly against OneLake, with no data movement. Power BI datasets in Direct Lake mode enjoy query performance on par with import mode, with the real-time nature of DirectQuery. And the data never leaves the lake.


**6. Synapse Real-time Analytics**

Real-time Analytics is fully integrated with the entire suite of Microsoft Fabric products, for both data loading, data transformation, and advanced visualization scenarios. Quick access to data insights is achieved through automatic data streaming, automatic indexing and data partitioning of any data source or format, and by using the on-demand query generation and visualizations. The main items available in Real-time Analytics include: Eventstream for capturing, transforming, and routing real-time events to various destinations with a no-code experience.	A KQL database for data storage and management. Data loaded into a KQL database can be accessed in OneLake and is exposed to other Microsoft Fabric experiences. A KQL queryset to run queries, view, and customize query results on data. The KQL queryset allows you to save queries for future use, export, and share queries with others. It includes the option to generate a Power BI report.

## Exercise 1: Data Engineering experience, Including Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical data sources into OneLake

### Task 1.1: Create a Microsoft Fabric enabled workspace

Here, we will see how each department at Contoso was able to easily create a unique workspace for their data.

1. Open **Power BI** in a new tab by going to https://app.powerbi.com/.

2. In Power BI service, click on **Workspaces**.

3. Click the **+ New workspace** button.

	![Create Power BI Workspace.](media/task-1.1.2.png)

4. Type the name **contosoSales**, confirm that the name is **Available** and click **Apply**.

>If the name contosoSales is already taken, add a suffix to the end of the name (for example **contosoSalesTest**).

>**Note:** Do not include spaces in the workspace name.

   ![Create Power BI Workspace.](media/task-1.1.3.png)

5. Click on **Workspaces** to verify if the workspace with the given name was created, if not perform the steps above again.

   ![Create Power BI Workspace.](media/task-1.1-new4.png)

### Task 1.2: Create/Build a Lakehouse

Now, let's see how each department in Contoso could easily create a Lakehouse in their workspace without any provisioning needed by simply providing the name, given the proper access rights of course!

1. In Power BI service, click **+ New** and then select **Show all**.

>**Note:** You may see **More options** instead of Show all. 

   ![Close the browser.](media/task-1.2.1.png)

2. In the new window, under the Data Engineering section, click on **Lakehouse (Preview)**.

    ![Close the browser.](media/task-1.2.2.png)

## Exercise 2: Explore an analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables. Stitch data (landed earlier) to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse and integrate with OneLake

### Task 2.1: Set up an Azure Databricks environment

**Integrate OneLake with Databricks:**

- **1. Use OneLake with existing data lakes using Shortcuts**

- **2. Use and land data directly in OneLake**

**In this exercise**, you will use second option **Use and land data directly in OneLake**.

Contoso already had some of their compute workload on **Azure Databricks**. You don’t need to migrate any of that workload to work with Fabric. You can simply use the OneLake endpoint to mount the storage and work with the same data directly from the Lakehouse for their analytical and ML operations.

**Currently there are two ways to authenticate OneLake.**

- **Credential passthrough**

- **Service Principal approach** (In this lab, you will use Service Principal approach)

1. From the left navigation pane, click on **Workspaces** and select the **contosoSales** workspace.

	![Databricks.](media/task-1.3-ext-shortcut.png)

2. Click on the **three dots** and select **Manage access**.

>**Note:** Manage access might be available in the pane also. If so, there is no need to click on the three dots.

*Wait for the Notebook to execute successfully*

14. Once the setup notebook runs successfully, mounting to the storage account is complete.

>**Note:** Please wait couple of minutes to finish execution. You can check last cell of notebook for last execution time to verify.

### Task 2.2: Create a Delta Live Table pipeline

In this task, you can create a Delta Live Table pipeline.

*Delta Live Tables (DLT) allow you to build and manage reliable data pipelines that deliver high-quality data in Lakehouse. DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery.*

After mounting the OneLake location, it’s time to convert the **raw bronze files** into the **open standard delta parquet format**, supported by OneLake.

This can be done using any Spark compute either in Microsoft Fabric or Azure Databricks. In this lab you will use DLT pipelines to process the raw data from OneLake and store it back in Open Delta tables (**Bronze>Silver>Gold Layer**).

1. Select the **Workflows** icon in the left navigation pane.

	![Select Workflows](media/task-2.1.6.png)

2. Select the **Delta Live Tables** tab and click on the **Create pipeline** button.

	![Select Workflows](media/task-2.3.1.png)

3.	In the **Create pipeline window**, enter **Delta Live Table Pipeline** in the Pipeline name box.

	![create pipeline](media/task-2.3.2.png)

4.	In the **Source Code field**, select the **notebook icon**.

	![Notebook libraries](media/task-2.3.3.png)

5.	In the **Select source code** window, select the **02_DLT_Notebook.ipynb** notebook and click on **Select**.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3.4.png)

6. Click on the **Create** button.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3.4-2.png)

*Once you select **Create**, the Delta Live Table pipeline with all the notebook libraries added to the pipeline will be created.*

7. Click **Start**.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3.5.png)

*Databricks will start executing the pipeline which will take approximately 7-8 minutes.*

8. This is the view you would see once the pipeline is executed. Observe the data lineage of bronze, silver and gold tables.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3.6.png)


### Task 2.3: Explore SQL Analytics with Lakehouse SQL-endpoint

*Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse comes with a default SQL endpoint which can be used for querying purposes using SQL syntax*

*We can go from Lakehouse to SQL endpoint in the same window by selecting SQL endpoint from the Lakehouse dropdown menu in the top right corner of the window.*

1. While you are in the Fabric workspace, in the left navigation bar, click on **lakehouseSilver** to navigate to **SQL endpoint**.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3-sql1.png)

>**Note:** You can also select lakehouseSilver from the contosoSales workspace.

2. Hard refresh the page using **Ctrl + Shift + R**. 

*A hard refresh helps load the delta tables in the lakehouse.*

3. Click the **Lakehouse dropdown button** in the top right corner of the screen and select **SQL analytics endpoint**.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3-sql2.png)

>**Note:** Wait for the SQL endpoint to load.

4. Here is a list of all the tables in open-standard delta format. We can run queries on these tables to get the insights we need for the next step.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3-sql3.png)

#### SQL Query

5. Click on the **New SQL Query** button.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3-sql4.png)

6. **Copy** the SQL query.

```
Select fc.ProductCategory,Sum(fc.Revenue) Revenue from [lakehouseSilver].[dbo].[dimension_product] dp JOIN [lakehouseSilver].[dbo].[fact_campaigndata] fc on dp.Category=fc.[ProductCategory] Group by fc.ProductCategory having sum(fc.[Revenue])< (Select Top 1 Sum(fc.Revenue) Revenue from [lakehouseSilver].[dbo].[dimension_product] dp JOIN [lakehouseSilver].[dbo].[fact_campaigndata] fc on dp.Category=fc.[ProductCategory] Group by fc.ProductCategory ORDER by Revenue DESC) ORDER by Revenue DESC
```
7. Click on **Run** icon to view the query result.

	![Select Notebook](media/task-2.3.7-new.png)

*We can write a query to get the insights from sales data that we ingested using the shortcut names 'sales-transaction-litware'.*

*We can also run queries with complex joins on the same table to get LitWare Inc.’s top 10 bestselling products and see how fast we can get the results. When running the queries, we get the result within seconds, and once it is in cold cache, it will take even less time to get the results. These queries showcase the data engineering experience in Microsoft Fabric.*

*You also have an option to create a visual query.*

## Exercise 3: Data Science experience including Machine Learning scenarios.

So, we saw how Contoso was able to combine their historical gold layer data from ADLS Gen2 with all the data in OneLake via shortcuts. We saw delta live tables being created for further curation of data in Azure Databricks. Next, as Miguel, the Data a Scientist, you can explore the power of ML models in Azure Databricks being leveraged on that data so Contoso can gain meaningful insights about customer churn predictions.

### Task 3.1: Build ML models, experiments, Log ML model in the built-in model registry using MLflow and batch scoring

#### Databricks

The architecture diagram shown here illustrates the end-to-end MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLflow.

After multiple iterations with various hyperparameters, the best performing model is registered in the Databricks MLflow model registry. Then it is set up as the model serving in the Azure Databricks Workspace for low latency requests.
	
   ![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.1.png)

1. Navigate back to the **Databricks workspace** we started for the previous exercise.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Workspace** and click **Workspace** again. Click on the **03_ML_Solutions_in_a_Box.ipynb** notebook.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.2.png)

Now that we've processed our customer data, let us use Machine learning model to predict customer churn

Ultimately, we would like to understand our customers' sentiment so we can create targeted campaigns to improve our sales.

3. Navigate to **cmd 10**.

With the data prepared, we can begin exploring the patterns it contains. 

As illustrated in this chart, we can see a high churn rate is seen if the customer tenure is low, and they have a lower spend amount.

   ![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.4.png)

4. Navigate to **cmd 20**.

5. Navigate to **cmd 21**. 

By registering this model in Model Registry, we can easily reference the model from anywhere within Databricks. 
	
![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.5.png)


6. Review the **cmd 29** cell.

This comparison of multiple runs using a parallel coordinates plot, shows the impact of different parameter values on a metric.

The best ML model for Customer Churn is selected and registered with Databricks model registry.

   ![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.6.png)

7. Navigate to **cmd 40**.

It is then used to predict the probability of Customer Churn using the deployed model and this model endpoint is ready for production.

   ![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.8.png)

8. Navigate to **cmd 41**. 

Once we have the predicted data, it is stored back in delta tables in the gold layer back in OneLake.

   ![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.9.png)	


## Exercise 4: Power BI reports with Direct Lake

So, we saw that Contoso was able to have all their organizational data in OneLake in Microsoft Fabric while still continuing to invest in Azure Databricks from their existing architecture. With the new Direct Lake mode in Power BI, they no longer have to choose between data latency or performance; they could get both!

Next, as Wendy, the business analyst let us see how we can leverage the Power BI Direct Lake mode experience in Microsoft Fabric!

### Task 4.1: Leverage Power BI to derive actionable insights from data in Lakehouse using Direct Lake mode.

1. **Open** a new web session (tab), and then **navigate** to [https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com)

>**Note:** Dismiss any popups that appear on your screen

2. In Power BI tab, click on **Workspace** ContosoSales and **Filter** on **Semantic model (default)**. Select the **lakehouseGold** Semantic model.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.new1.png)

3. Click on the **dropdown icon** beside 'Explore this data' and select **Auto-create a report**.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.new7.png)

5. **Goto** the reports location in the Github repository by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/tree/ignite-lab-2023/ignite/artifacts/reports).

6. **Click** on the 'Campaign Analytics Report with Lakehouse.pbix' report.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.new3.png)

7. **Click** on the 'Download' button.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.new4.png)

8. Similarly download the other two reports as well.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.new5.png)

9. **Go back** to Power BI service, click on **Workspaces** and click on **contosoSales**. 

	![Close the browser.](media/task-3.1.10.png)

10. Click on **Upload** and select **Browse**.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.10.png)

11. **Browse** to the location from your local system where you downloaded the reports, select the **Campaign Analytics Report with Lakehouse.pbix** report and click on the **Open** button.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.11.png)

>**Note:** Wait for the report to upload.

12. **Open** the report by clicking on it.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.12.png)

>**Note:** Make sure to click on the **Report** and not the Dataset or Dashboard which is auto created with the same name.

   ![Task 6](media/task-6.1.20.png)

13. Close the pop-up.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.20new.png)

. This report has three sections:
 - Churn Analysis
 - Campaign Analytics
 - Website Analytics

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.13.png)

10. Let's navigate to the **Churn Analysis Tab**, where we analyze Customer Churn. This report, along with the Campaign Analytics and Website Analytics reports in Power BI, are coming from the data Lakehouse that we created in earlier exercises.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.14.png)

In the **Scatter Chart** on the left, the blue dots represent customers that are more likely to churn, and the peach dots represent customers that are less likely to churn. Notice that when customer tenure is low and their spend amount is low, the customers are more likely to churn.

   ![Task 6](media/task-6.1.15.png)

With this insight, Contoso decides to target customers with lesser tenure and lesser spend amounts through their new campaigns.

Now, let's go the Campaign Analytics.

10. Select the **Campaign Analytics** tab from the top right pane to navigate to the Campaign Analytics report.

	![Task 6](media/task-6.1.16.png)

In this Campaign Analytics report, the bar chart shows that the most popular campaigns Contoso launched were gogreen and sustainablefashion.

   ![Task 6](media/task-6.1.17.png)

With this insight, Contoso team decides to target customers with lesser tenure and lesser spend amounts through their new campaigns.

Now, let's go Website Analytics. 

11. Select **Website Analytics** from the top right pane to navigate to the Website Analytics Report.

   ![Task 6](media/task-6.1.18.png)

Here we see an immediate problem for Contoso. The bounce rate of customers from their web site is high. In fact a large population of the unhappy customers who contribute to the high bounce rate on their website are Millennials. It turns out that when the millenial customers use their mobile devices to search for their favorite products such as beach accessories, their product searches are failing! That is the reason why millenials are unhappy.

   ![Task 6](media/task-6.1.19.png)

Contoso reduced their bounce rate by implementing a mobile-friendly website with fast product searches, focusing on high demand products for millennials. These changes improved the bounce rate and increased sales.

Congratulations! You, as a part of Contoso's technical team played the roles of a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data/ Business Analyst to help Contoso gain actionable insights from its disparate data sources, thereby contributing to future growth, customer satisfaction, and a competitive advantage.

During our exercises, we saw how they leveraged the power of Microsoft Fabric to ingest data from disparate sources, combine data with their existing data from ADLS Gen2, derive meaningful insights. You experienced how the team used a shortcut to reference the existing Litware Inc data from ADLS Gen2. You also experienced how they mounted the OneLake endpoint in Azure Databricks to derive meaningful insights using the compute in Azure Databricks.

Finally, we leveraged Power BI to derive actionable insights from data in the Lakehouse using Direct Lake mode.
As a result of all these data insights, Contoso had a great year and they celebrated on December 31st with fireworks!

5. Select all using **Ctrl + A** and **delete** the pre-written query.

	![Close the browser.](media/task-5.3.5.png)

6. **Paste** the query provided below in the query section.

```
//What is the average temperature every 1 min?
thermostat | where EnqueuedTimeUTC >= ago(1d) | where DeviceId == 'TH005' | summarize avg(Temp) by bin(EnqueuedTimeUTC,1m) | render timechart 

//What will be the temperature for next 15 Minutes?
thermostat | where EnqueuedTimeUTC > ago(1d) | make-series AvgTemp=avg(Temp) default=real(null) on EnqueuedTimeUTC from ago(1d) to now()+15m step 1m  | extend NoGapsTemp=series_fill_linear(AvgTemp) | project EnqueuedTimeUTC, NoGapsTemp | extend forecast = series_decompose_forecast(NoGapsTemp, 15) | render timechart with(title='Forecasting the next 15min by Time Series Decmposition')

//Are there any anomalies for this device?
thermostat | where EnqueuedTimeUTC > ago(1h) | where DeviceId == 'TH005'| make-series AvgTemp=avg(Temp) default=real(null) on EnqueuedTimeUTC from ago(1d) to now() step 1m | extend NoGapsTemp=series_fill_linear(AvgTemp) | project EnqueuedTimeUTC, NoGapsTemp | extend anomalies = series_decompose_anomalies(NoGapsTemp,1) | render anomalychart with(anomalycolumns=anomalies)
```

7. **Select** the query. (Line 2)

8. **Click** Run.

The graph/result visualizes the data in a line chart. We see that it looks like the temperature is currently quite pleasant.

9. **Select** the query. (Line 5)

10. **Click** Run.

The graph/result visualizes the average temperature in the next 15 minutes, in anticipation of heavy foot traffic due to the ongoing sale.

11. **Select** the query. (Line 8)

12. **Click** Run.

The third query is executed to keep an eye on the temperature and detect any anomalies. A sudden rise or drop in temperature triggers an alert for the Contoso staff to check the situation and take necessary action to bring the temperature back to an optimal level.

Congratulations! You as Data Engineers have helped Contoso gain actionable insights from its disparate data sources, thereby contributing to future growth, customer satisfaction, and a competitive advantage.

In this lab we experienced the creation of a simple integrated, open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation using Modern Analytics with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks.

In this lab we covered the following:

First, we explored the Data Engineering experience and learned how to create a Microsoft Fabric enabled workspace, build a Lakehouse, and ingest data into OneLake.

Second, we explored an analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables. We stitched streaming and non-streaming data (landed earlier), to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse and integrate with OneLake.

Third, we explored ML and BI scenarios on the Lakehouse. Here we reviewed MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLflow with Azure ML.

Fourth, we explored SQL Analytics in the Data Warehouse experience where we created a Data Warehouse, loaded data into the warehouse, and then created a virtual Data Warehouse.

Fifth, we explored Streaming data using KQL DB for a Real-time Analytics experience. Here, we created a KQL Database, ingested real-time and historical data into KQL DB, analyzed patterns to uncover anomalies and outliers, and created a Real-time Power BI report using KQL DB and KQL Query.

Finally, we leveraged Power BI to derive actionable insights from data in the Lakehouse using Direct Lake mode.
